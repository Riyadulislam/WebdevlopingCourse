                        <p>Cross-origin resource sharing ( CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted 
                            resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain
                             from which the first resource was served. [1] A web page may freely embed 
                             cross-origin images, stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and videos. [2] Certain
                              "cross-domain" requests, notably Ajax requests
                            , are forbidden by default by the same-origin security policy.</p>

                        <p>Nodes are the custodians of a blockchain. They keep all copies of the ledger in sync, 
                            storing encrypted data of past transactions while taking on new blocks for scalable growth.
                             They are algorithmically
                             programmed to execute transactions based on a majority consensus</p>

                    <h3 className='headerc'>How does private route work?</h3>
                    <p>Private peering routes requests to the customer's private Azure services, for example, Azure Virtual Machines. Each peering is a pair of independent Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) sessions, 
                        each configured redundantly for high availability.</p>
